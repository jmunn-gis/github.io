# Jen's GIS Portfolio

I have been a student in the GIS program at Colorado Mountain College for the past two years, working towards my Advanced GIS certificate.  This is a collection of my GIS projects.  I am passionate about the mapping and analysis of biological and natural resources.  My goal is to contribute to environmental stewardship utilzing my GIS skills in a long term career with the Forest Service.
