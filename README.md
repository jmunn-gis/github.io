# Jen's GIS Portfolio

I have been a student in the GIS program at Colorado Mountain College for the past two years, working towards my Advanced GIS certificate.  This is a collection of my GIS projects.  I am passionate about the mapping and analysis of biological and natural resources.  My goal is to contribute to environmental stewardship utilzing my GIS skills in a long term career with the Forest Service.     
## California Park Vegetation Change
This map depicts the vegetation change within California Park in Routt National Forest, Colorado from a non-drought year and a drought year.  It shows this change in relation to the ephemeral stream network, and will be used by the Forest Service in deciding where to initiate restoration efforts using the Zeedyk method.

## Clear Creek Beaver Restoration Potential 
This analysis shows the creek segments in Clear Creek drainage in Chaffee County, Colorado that may be conducive to restoration utilizing beaver reintroduction or beaver dam analogues.

## California Park Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool Data
This map displays several of the main data layers in California Park, Routt National Forest, that were pre-processed for use in running the Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool (BRAT).  The BRAT will be run and, ultimately, this map will be used by the Forest Service in considering whether or not to use beaver reintroduction or beaver dam analogues for creek restoration.
