# Jen's GIS Portfolio

I am a student in the Natural Resource Management program at Colorado Mountain College.  This is a collection of my GIS projects.  I have enjoyed focusing on mapping of our biological and natural resources.  I hope to continue this focus in my GIS career, but am curious to explore mapping of many other elements and aspects.   
# A Compelling Comeback - Bald Eagles in Colorado
One of the highlights of my portfolio is my story and mapping showing the bald eagle's presence in the state of Colorado.  My objective was to demonstrate that the bird has overcome it's challenges of the past, and has become more prevlanent in the state.
