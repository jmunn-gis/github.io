# Jen's GIS Portfolio

I have been a student in the GIS program at Colorado Mountain College for the past two years, working towards my Advanced GIS certificate.  This is a collection of my GIS projects.  I am passionate about the mapping and analysis of biological and natural resources.  My goal is to contribute to environmental stewardship utilzing my GIS skills in a long term career with the Forest Service.     

## Bald Eagle Story Map
The following is a story map that presents the narrative of the bald eagle's comeback in the state of Colorado.  This story map is available to the public and serves as an inspirational example of the importance of environmental stewardship and resource management.

## California Park Vegetation Change
Utilzing NDVI remote sensing data, this map depicts the vegetation change within California Park in Routt National Forest, Colorado.  It shows the change in vegetation in relation to the ephemeral stream network from a non-drought year to a drought year.  This is the initial analysis completed as part of an ongoing research project for the Routt National Forest and will be ultimately used by the Forest Service team in deciding where to initiate restoration efforts using the Zeedyk method.

## California Park Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool Data
This map displays several of the critical data layers that were pre-processed using advanced methods for use in running the Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool (BRAT) for California Park in Routt National Forest.  The BRAT will be run and, ultimately, this map will be used by the Forest Service team in considering whether or not to use beaver reintroduction or beaver dam analogues for creek restoration in the vital ecosystem of California Park.

## Clear Creek Beaver Restoration Potential 
This map analysis shows the creek segments within Clear Creek drainage in Chaffee County, Colorado that may be conducive to restoration utilizing beaver reintroduction or beaver dam analogues.  It will be used to present possible ecosystem management options to the Pike San Isabel Forest Service team.
