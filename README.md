# Jen's GIS Portfolio

I have been a student in the GIS program at Colorado Mountain College for the past two years, working towards my Advanced GIS certificate.  This is a collection of my GIS projects.  I am passionate about the mapping and analysis of biological and natural resources.  My goal is to contribute to environmental stewardship utilzing my GIS skills in a long term career with the Forest Service.     
## California Park NDVI
This map depicts the vegetation change within California Park in Routt National Forest, Colorado from a non-drought year and a drought year.  It shows this change in relation to the ephemeral stream network, and will be used by the Forest Service in deciding where to initiate restoration efforts using the Zeedyk method.
