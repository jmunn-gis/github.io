# Jen's GIS Portfolio

I am a student in the Natural Resource Management program at Colorado Mountain College.  This is a collection of my GIS projects.  I have enjoyed focusing on mapping of our biological and natural resources.  I hope to continue this focus in my GIS career, but am curious to explore mapping of many other elements and aspects.
