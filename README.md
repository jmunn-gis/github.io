# Jen's GIS Portfolio

I have been a student in the GIS program at Colorado Mountain College for the past two years, working towards my Advanced GIS certificate.  This is a collection of my GIS projects.  I am passionate about the mapping and analysis of biological and natural resources.  My goal is to contribute to environmental stewardship utilizing my GIS skills in a long-term career with the Forest Service.   

## Leadville Dispersed Camping Map 
This map was created for the U.S. Forest Service, Leadville Ranger District. It depicts the dispersed campsites near Twin Lakes recreation area in Lake County, Colorado. This map will be expanded upon as new campsite surveys are completed.  It will serve to inform the District's Dispersed Management Camping Plan to be initiated in 2022.

## California Park Vegetation Change
Utilizing NDVI remote sensing data, this map depicts the vegetation change within California Park in Routt National Forest, Colorado.  It shows the change in vegetation in relation to the ephemeral stream network from a non-drought year to a drought year.  This is the initial analysis completed as part of an ongoing research project that the Forest Service team will implement in the use of stream restoration efforts using the Zeedyk method in the vital ecosystem of California Park.

## California Park Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool Data
This map displays several of the critical data layers that were pre-processed for use in running the Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool (BRAT) for California Park in Routt National Forest, Colorado.  The BRAT will be run and, ultimately, this map will be used by the Forest Service team in considering whether or not to use beaver reintroduction or beaver dam analogs for creek restoration in the vital ecosystem of California Park.

## Clear Creek Beaver Restoration Potential 
This map analysis shows the creek segments within Clear Creek drainage in Chaffee County, Colorado that may be conducive to restoration utilizing beaver reintroduction or beaver dam analogs.  It will be used to present possible ecosystem management options to the Pike-San Isabel Forest Service team.
